- modules and functions

basic units of an erlang program, modules contain functions.

* modules are where we store code.

-module(blah).     % module declaration
must be the same name as the file.

-export([blah/0]). % export declaration 
Name/N means a function called Name with N arguments.
functions not exported are private to module.

function pattern matching clauses are separated by semi-colons.

head() -> body.

* directories and code paths
pwd().   - prints the current working directory
ls().    - lists the names of the files in cwd.
cd(Dir). - changes to current working directory.

* adding tests to code.
using pattern matching can be used to create effective tests
for erlang functions.
